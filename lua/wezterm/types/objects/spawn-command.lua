---The `SpawnCommand` struct specifies information
---about a new command to be spawned.
---
---It is a Lua object with the following fields;
---all of the fields have reasonable defaults and can be omitted.
---
---@class SpawnCommand
---The argument array specifying the command and its arguments.
---
---If omitted, the default program for the target domain will be
---spawned.
---
---@field args? string[]
---An optional label.
---
---The `label` is only used for `SpawnCommand` instances
---that are listed in the `launch_menu` configuration section.
---
---If `label` is omitted, a default will be produced based
---on the `args` field.
---
---@field label? string
---The current working directory to set for the command.
---
---If omitted, wezterm will infer a value based on the active pane
---at the time this action is triggered.
---
---If the active pane matches the domain specified in this `SpawnCommand` instance
---then the current working directory of the active pane will be used.
---
---If the current working directory cannot be inferred then it
---will typically fall back to using the home (`$HOME`) directory of
---the current user.
---
---@field cwd? string
---Sets additional environment variables in the environment for
---this command invocation.
---
---@field set_environment_variables? table<string, any>|table
---Specifies that the multiplexer domain of the currently active pane
---should be used to start this process.
---
---@field domain? "DefaultDomain"
---Specifies the initial position for a GUI window when this command
---is used in a context that will create a new window, such as with:
---
--- - [`wezterm.mux.spawn_window()`](lua://Wezterm.Mux.spawn_window)
--- - `SpawnCommandInNewWindow`
---
---@field position? SpawnPosition
